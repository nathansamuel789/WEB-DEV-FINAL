            “Bleach: Thousand Year Blood War” Part 2 ended on September 30,2023, but fans can’t
            contain their excitement. We’ve watched Ichigo grow up as a substitute soul user
            and the Soul Society was the place where his friends Rukia and Renji lived. 
            To watch their homes devastated, to witness the brutalization of the people
            he considered to be his kind, and to learn such a riveting truth about his past, 
            isn’t easy on a 19-year-old who should be in college. Kubo pulls out all the 
            stops in this arc and shows the death and destruction in graphic detail.<br>
            From charred bones to melting faces, some of the scenes in this arc 
            might be disturbing. With crisp animation and some amazing background music,
            the 10-year wait seem worth it. While Ichigo’s teammates, like Chad and Orihime,
            each episode tops the last and makes take the bench for most of the arc, Urahara 
            proves efficient like always. The characters of Komamura, Sasakibe, Shuhei Hisagi, 
            and the rest are fleshed out more, giving them more of a personality. 
            While the fate of Soul Society and that of Ichigo shall be revealed in time, 
            fans are also excited about some 
            of the most anticipated Bankai releases of the big shots of Bleach.
